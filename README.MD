# Project Title

## Description
DhammaBot is an AI-powered chatbot designed to provide insights and guidance based on Buddhist teachings and principles. This project uses natural language processing and machine learning techniques to engage users in meaningful conversations about Buddhism, meditation, mindfulness, and spiritual growth.

The bot analyzes user queries and responds with relevant teachings, suttas (Buddhist scriptures), and practical advice drawn from Buddhist philosophy. It aims to make Buddhist wisdom more accessible to both beginners and experienced practitioners through an interactive, conversational interface.

Key features include:
- Natural language understanding of Buddhist terminology and concepts
- Response generation based on canonical Buddhist texts
- Ability to provide meditation guidance and mindfulness tips
- Multi-language support for broader accessibility
- Context-aware conversations about Buddhist philosophy and practice

This project serves as an educational tool for those interested in learning about Buddhism, as well as a practice companion for established practitioners seeking daily guidance and inspiration.
